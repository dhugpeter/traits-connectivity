```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r cars}
dflmer <- readRDS("../Tables/dflmer_w.rds")
str(dflmer)
plot(dflmer$RarRichness ~ log(dflmer$Overflow))
hist(dflmer$RarRichness)
plot(dflmer$FRic ~ log(dflmer$Overflow))
hist(dflmer$FRic)
dotplot(RarRichness ~ log(Overflow)| station + season,dflmer, groups=station)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
m1 <- lm(RarRichness ~ 1, data=dflmer)
summary(m1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
